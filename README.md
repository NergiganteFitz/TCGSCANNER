##Applications Current State/Development
In the Application's current state, it is only able to identify cards by their names, and only
work with Cards from the Table Top Card Game. Magic The Gathering.
Baseball, Match Attax, Pokemon TCG, and Yu-gi-oh cards will not work in the app's current condition.

Future updates will require machine learning/AI to learn and recognise cards in a more detailed capacity, 
with the main aim for the application in the next update being to be able to recognise a card's multiverse IDs. 
These IDs are only related to Magic The Gathering Cards and are unique identifiers.

Later versions will include more Card Games/Collectables as scan options.
